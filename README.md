Neovim configuration, based on [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsz00TDipIffreIaUNk64KxTIkQaGguqn) video series by typecraft. Main features of the config:

* Configured mostly for C/C++, Haskell, Lua and Python.
* Includes LSP, linters and formatters.
* Debugging setup for C/C++ using gdb. I didn't spend too much time on this as I mostly use an external debugger.

Note : npm (node package manager) is needed to install pyright.
